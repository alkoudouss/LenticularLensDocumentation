As a preview of what can be done with the **Lenticular Lens** tool, we list here the main menus composing the tool and provide a brief description of what can be done in each of the menu. 

* <span style="color:blue"> **RESEARCH.** </span> In this menu, we illustrates how to defined the scope of a research.

* <span style="color:blue"> **SELECT.** </span>  In this menu, we illustrates how to:
	* Use the default Golden Agent's endpoint or to provide other GraphQL locations so that remote datasources can be located and made available to the user;
	
	* Select (datasources and data-types) from the available list of datasources at the remote location so that data can be integrated and vital information can be extracted in order to conduct our experiment; 
	
	* Define restrictions over selected entity-types. 

* <span style="color:blue"> **CREATE.** </span>  In this menu, we show how to use and combine resolution methods.

* <span style="color:blue"> **MANIPULATE.** </span>  In this menu, we show how to apply set like operations (Union, Intersection, Difference, Composition and In-Set) over linksets and lenses.

* <span style="color:blue"> **VALIDATE.** </span>  In this menu, we show how to validate existing links (accept, reject, validation rational) for analysis or method accuracy. We also show in this menu how to use the visualisation feature to ease to some extent the validation task.

* <span style="color:blue"> **EXPORT.** </span> This menu illustrates the reach options supporting the export of a linkset or lens.

* <span style="color:blue"> **EXTRACT.** </span>  In this last menu, we show how the user can materialise the entity-based integration of her selected datasource for the extraction of information vital to her analysis. 

The rest of the manual will first discuss **LINK CONSTRUCTION** (it includes the `RESEARCH`, `SELECT` and `CREATE` options), then **LINK MANIPULATION** (it includes the `MANIPULATE`, and `VALIDATION` options), followed by **LINK EXPORT** (it is about the `EXPORT` option) and finally **INTEGRATION MODEL** (it is about the `EXTRACT` option).

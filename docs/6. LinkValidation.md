# 6. LINK VALIDATION
Imagine a researcher in the need of integrating data on publications, authors and education institutions. Wrongly executing this integration task could mean, for example, assigning the h-index of author A to author B or wrongly saying that author A is affiliated to an institution he has never been involved with. To reaching a solid investigation result, this highlights the crucial importance of link validation once links have been created and possibly improved.
